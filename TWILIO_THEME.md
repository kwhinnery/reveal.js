# Using the Twilio Theme

The Twilio presentation theme utilizes fonts that we have purchased, including Gotham Black and Gotham Ultra.  Please obtain these fonts, and place them in the appropriate directory.  Everything else at this point should just work.

## Creating your own presentations

To create a new presentation, copy `twilio.html` to `yourpreso.twilio.html`.  This will allow you to seamlessly `git pull` any changes to the master template in the future without polluting the rest of the repo.  Open `yourpreso.twilio.html` in Google Chrome for best results (other browsers should probably work, too).
